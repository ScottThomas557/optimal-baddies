## Guild Overview
The goal of OB is to be a competitive raiding guild on the US-Blade’s Edge / US-Thunderhorn connected server.  The guild has chosen to push top tier content on a condensed 2 night raiding schedule.  This means that time on task in raids will be crucial.  The current schedule is:

* **Progression**: Tuesday and Wednesday 9-11:30pm EST
* **Optional / Alts**: Friday and Saturday 9-11:30pm EST

## Raider Info

**All Raiders must come prepared**.  The term prepared can be ambiguous, but to the OB community coming prepared means the following:

* You have consumables for yourself (detailed below)
* You have watched all videos pinned in discord to be acquainted with the fights
* You are logged in EARLY, so that first pull may occur promptly at raid start
* Show up with a positive attitude. We will die a lot, progression is not a cakewalk

### Raid preparation checklist
* 40 Battle Potions
* 2 Personal Flasks
* 20 Personal +55 stat food
* 20 [Battle-Scarred Augment Rune](https://www.wowhead.com/item=160053/battle-scarred-augment-rune)
* 1 [Vantus Rune: Uldir](https://www.wowhead.com/item=153673/vantus-rune-uldir)

Note on preparedness - The guild will provide cauldrons, feasts, and enchants. This does not mean you shouldn’t be prepared in the event the guild items are not available for the night.

### Consumable Expectations

	* Guild will provide cauldrons

	* Progression defined as new or 2nd kills

### Raid Nights
OB Leadership has decided to create a Raid Lead role.  This role will be responsible for calling out pertinent raid information, providing immediate feedback, and directing players during raid. The Raid Lead will have authority during raid, deferring only to the GM.

Rules for Discord:
Use push-to-talk if you cannot keep coms clear
Keep the line free from unneeded discussion during progression
